Installation
------------

Installation of Scrum-it is really easy.

### Prerequisites

Before installing Scrum-it, please make sure you have these components installed:
* MySQL 5.5.x
* Tomcat Server 6.x or 7.x

### Installation steps

You only have to do a few steps to get Scrum-it up and running...

Get the sources from http://sourceforge.net/projects/scrum-it/files/ or build your own war file with the source code distrubuted here.
Then drop the scrumit.war file into the webapp folder of your Tomcat.

Next, you have to create a database with the name `scrumit` and configure the MySQL server.
Further you have to edit the file /src/hibernate.cfg.xml. There you have to change the values for connection.url, connection.username and connection.password.
Running Scrum-it for the first time, the database tables will be created automatically by taking the value `create` instead of `none` into the hbm2ddl property.
After that, the database tables are created and you can change back the value to `none`.

Now, start your Tomcat Server and enjoy Scrum-it on every webbrowser (Firefox, Safari, Opera, Internet Explorer 9 and Google Chrome): http://127.0.0.1:8080/scrumit/
